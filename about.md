  <h4 class='underline'>Less Conventional way</h4>

  I have been living in Paris for 10 years. I grew up in Normandy and I've travelled a bit throughout France. Le Havre, Annecy, Paris..for my studies, mainly in marketing, I was graduated from business school in 2011.

  After 2/3 years of work I decided to move for 1 year in Toronto, Canada. Simply to improve my poor english and work as garde-manger, cooker and also as sales rep within wine industry.<br><br>

  Then I came back to France and I worked as sales rep...but definitely it wasn't for me. So I decided to launch my own tech product..but I couldn't find developers in my surrounding, from this time I've started to learn HTML/CSS as the first baby-step to learn code.<br><br>

  But quickly I felt in love with the magic of coding and I decided to switch job to be part of the tech team. I studied at <a href='https://www.lewagon.com/'>Le Wagon Bootcamp (Paris)</a>. After my graduation I worked on some small missions as Ruby dev..but my career really started when I've begun to work within <a href='https://www.captive.fr/'>Captive Studio</a> (my current job) as Ruby On Rails Developer.

  <span class='blue'>Code: </span>To much sides projects started.
