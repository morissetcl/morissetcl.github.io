  <h4 class='underline'>Less Conventional way</h4>

  I'm living in Paris in the 18th district, close to Montmartre. I grew up in Normandy and I travel a bit throughout France. Le Havre, Annecy, Paris..to my studies, mainly in marketing, I was graduated from business school in 2011.

  After 2/3 years of work I decided to move during 1 year in Toronto, Canada. Simply to improve my poor english and work as garde-manger, cooker and also as sales rep within wine industry.<br><br>

  But I came back to France and I worked as sales rep...but definetly it wasn't for me. So I decided to launch my own tech product..but I was not surrounded by developer, from this time I started to learn HTML/CSS as the first baby-step to learn code.<br><br>

  But quickly I was falling in love with the magick from code and I decided to switch of job to make part of tech team. I studied at <a href='https://www.lewagon.com/'>Le Wagon Bootcamp (Paris)</a>. After I worked over some small missions as Ruby dev..but my career really started when I start to work within <a href='https://www.captive.fr/'>Captive Studio</a> (my current job) as Ruby On Rails Developer.

  <p class='subtitle'>What I do after work.</p>

  <span class='blue'>Graffiti:</span> I am painting from my 16 years old. From wall to canvas I like to spend time to create, make colors and play with letters.<br>

  <span class='blue'>Concert::</span> Jump in concert. French Rap from 90's to 00 best music over the world..just after Gospel Church.<br>

  <span class='blue'>Code::</span> Yeah..To much sides projects started..and some Meetup.
