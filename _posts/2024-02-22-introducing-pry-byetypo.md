If youâ€™re anything like me, itâ€™s likely that you have sausage-like fingers.ðŸŒ­
As a result, you might find yourself making typos on your REPL daily.
This is why I am thrilled to introduce Pry-Byetypo.
It is a small Pry plugin who captures exceptions that may arise from typos and deduces the correct command based on your database information and session history.
