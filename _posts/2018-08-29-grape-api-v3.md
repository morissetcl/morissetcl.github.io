This is our last part and so far you can be proud of what you build. We have build two routes in our API. We can return a list of books and also get a specific book from an id. We introduced entities which allows us to choose which datas we want to display. Itâ€™s pretty good but not enough yet. So in this final part we will see how to add nested resources and how to add entities.
