I have been publishing 3 gems for 2 years, of course I didnâ€™t change the game with them. No much stars, no much users..and not really sure to save time/life of many developers.
But embrace gems development and more widely the open-source is oddly satisfying, each gem taught me something. Below my thoughts that I wanted to share with you.
