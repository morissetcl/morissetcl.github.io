For a while I wanted to build a front-end app with Rails backend. I was looking for the right JS framework and the right way to implement. So after some research my choice fell on EmberJS. If you are looking for why, feel free to follow this link. This Medium is dedicated to you if your are like me, with some interesting knowledges in rails, but a bit lost throw the multitude of JS framework.
